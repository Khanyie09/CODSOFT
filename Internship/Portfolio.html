                    <h2>Ward Management System</h2>
                    <p>This is a third-year project that I am currently doing with my team at school.
                     We are developing a website for a hospital ward, including all the functionalities you might expect: creating a patient file,
                      admitting the patient, treating the patient, and finally discharging the patient.
                    The technologies we are using for this project include Dapper, Entity Framework, SQL Server Management Studio, and C#.</p>

                    <h2>Hope Haven Organisation</h2>
                    <p>I entered a competition called GirlCode Hackathon with my team members, 
                    where we chose to develop a secure web application.
                     In this application, we act as intermediaries.
                     People who would like to donate items to charity homes can register on our website and state or select the things they are able to donate. 
                     We then pick up those donations and deliver them to the charity homes.
                    The technologies we will use is C#, Dapper, SQL Server Management Studio, Entity Framework</p>
